# IronStar-Content-for-Foundry
Ironsworn and Starforged content module for Foundry VTT

Description

My current repository of tables for Ironsworn and Starforged. Some important macros are included, including template macros to build off of. One such template will roll off of a random table in a specified folder, allowing you to create more tables and drop them in the folder to be included in the roll without requiring you to change anything in the macro other than the name of the folder in the first line of the macro. This allows you to expand the word database of The Oracle tables as simple as possible without having to code.

Content-generating macros (Sector creation, Planet creation, Settlement creation) should adhere to the folder naming conventions, as these are detailed macros that use several tables to generate content.

Naming Convention and Folder Structure

I have included 2 macros (1 for Ironsworn and 1 for Starforged) that will generate a folder structure for both games.

Some folders are named with brackets ("[ ]"). This serves a couple of purposes.

These are more "common" words, and this helps separate and locate them when scripts search by folder name.
It is an old trick I use to bring the more commonly used folders to the top of long folder lists when sorted alphabetically.
Change folder and table names at your own risk.

Recommendation

Install this module first into a new and empty game world to run the "Run Once" folder macro(s) so you get an understanding of the layout and also so you can look for potential conflicts with any RollTable folders you have. It is also recommended to have different game worlds for Ironsworn and Starforged, as some of the table names are common between the two tables. You can still use tables between systems (i.e. I use all of the "[ Action ]" tables from both modules in my Ironsworn and Starforged games).

Set Up

Once you have the folders generated, open the table compendium and start dragging and dropping files from the compendium to the folder. DO NOT install all at once. This will dump all the RollTables into one folder and then you will have to organize them. It is much easier to organize them from the compendium. I attempted to be very consistent with the naming, and the destination of the tables should be apparent.

Work in Progress

The intent of this module is to allow easy expansion for Ironsworn and Starforged. Both of these games rely on The Oracle for content, and the less content repeats, the more it adds to the immersion.

This document will change frequently and more details will be added covering specifics. The initial readme does not contain those specifics. Don't worry, this sounds a lot more scary than it really is.
